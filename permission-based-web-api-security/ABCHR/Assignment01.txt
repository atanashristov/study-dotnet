Assigment 01 - Seed Admin ApplicationUser

Create a function/method that seed ApplicationUser to database
Consider the following
	- Username should be genearated from email but do not include characters from @, 
		example: 'juniorm@gmail.com' should be 'juniorm'
	- Normalized properties should all be in upper cases
	- User should be Active
	- Check if the user with the same email does not exists before creating and no duplication is allowed
	- Password must be hashed, use new PasswordHasher<ApplicationUser>() to achieve this
Assign this user to both Basic and Admin roles, remember admin MUST has all permissions
	- Check if not already in roles [Admin and basic]
