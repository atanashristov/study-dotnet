# Prompt_Add_Docker_and_Docker_Compose_Files.md

## Task

I want to add all the needed files to the project to manage Docker Compose for the project.

We need a Postgres DB. It would expose it port to host.

For now this is all that we will have.

Please add the needed Docker and Compose files and instructions how to run the Docker cluster.
